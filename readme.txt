Stacks and Queues Assignment by Eli Ji

Needed Class Explanations:

LinkedList - minimal implementation, only contains methods needed for reverse

JosephusGraphics - This class runs the Josephus graphics... or was meant to... I attempted       to learn some more graphics. I thought illustrating the Josephus problem would be easy and cool, but it was hard and not cool. I ran out of time, but decided to submit what I have anyway. The program as of now draws people in a circle and the animated executioner (takes a while to load). Even though I did not get to illustrating the algorithm at all, I stilled learned a lot on how to do graphics properly and I can hopefully use this knowledge for future extensions.


GPerson & GExecutioner - These two classes are used in the JosephusGraphics class. A GPerson is simply a circle with a number centered in it. A GExecutioner is a circle with an axe and uses frame1-7.png for the swinging animation.
